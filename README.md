**ARDUINO PROJECTS**

In this repository you can find some very easy and interesting projects that you can make with a single Arduino. 

**But what exactly is an Arduino ?**

First of all, we have to undestand what the CPU of a computer actually is. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the most basic and important central component in a computer 
system that processes data, controls system operation and performs basic interface and command-passing functions. The CPU consists of a circuit of connected logic gates
and passive elements such as capacitors,diods,resistors etc., created on a sheet (named chip) of semiconductor material (mostly based on silicon) also known as 
an **Integrated Cicruit** .

If the CPU consists of only one integrated circuit, then it is called **Microprocessor** or **Microcontroller** .
Arduino belongs to the family of **Microcontrollers** .

**What is a Microcontroller? What are the differences between microcontrollers and microprocessors?**

A Microcontroller is a simple computer that can run a program over and over again.It can operate with minimal external components due to its many internal subsystems.Microcontrollers are used in industry in automation
in everyday electronic products such cameras, electrical appliances and all kinds of self-propellerd wheeled vehicles. On the other hand, a Microprocessor is essentially a pocket computer, usually with n operating system
like Linux and the ability to run multiple programs simultaneously. A strong example of a microprocessor is the famous **Raspberry Pi**.  Microcontrollers are cheaper than microprocessors. They are very trustworthly, they 
also act autonomously as they don't need any extra integrated circuit since they already got all the useful subsystems that they need. Last but not least, they are also much more economical in terms of energy since they 
have a low power consumption.
